# NotesApp Password Audit

Names:  Katie Guo and Hongrui Bian

## Finding 1 — Unsalted MD5

We cracked 4 out of 6 accounts in 0.4 ms using the public wordlist.

The cracked accounts were liwei, aisha, tomk and sofia.
marie and raj were not cracked because their passwords were not in this wordlist.

Severity:High, because 4 out of 6 accounts were cracked in only 0.4 ms. If the password database is stolen, attackers can guess common passwords very quickly.

Fix: Use Argon2 with a random salt to store passwords.

## Finding 2 — Speed comparison

| Hash | Guesses per second | Estimated guesses per day |
|---|---:|---:|
| MD5 | 2,284,367 | 197,369,308,800 |
| Argon2 | 14.3 | 1,235,520 |

![MD5 and Argon2 speed comparison](screenshots/hash-speed.png)

Argon2 took about 70 ms for one hash.
In our test, Argon2 was about 160,000 times slower per guess than MD5.

Verdict: MD5 allows attackers to try many passwords very quickly. Argon2 makes each guess much slower, so a large attack takes more time and resources. Weak passwords can still be guessed.

## Application check

Alice's password was upgraded to Argon2id after a successful login.
We logged out and logged in again successfully.
Other old accounts will upgrade when they next log in successfully.
